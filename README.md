Breast Cancer Detection using Artificial Neural Network.
An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to determine whether patients have breast cancer or not. Whether patients have cancer or not and if they have then its type can be determined by using ANN. Whether the cancer is benign or malignant is determined in this model. The model yeilds an accuracy of 97%.
